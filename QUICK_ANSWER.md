# Quick Answer: Which Option to Choose on PyPI?

## ✅ USE: GitHub

**Click the "GitHub" tab and fill in:**

```
PyPI Project Name: collab-tunnel
Owner: [your-github-username]
Repository name: collab-tunnel-python
Workflow name: publish.yml
Environment name: pypi
```

## ❌ DON'T USE: Google

The Google option is for Google Cloud Build integration, which you don't need. It's unnecessarily complex and not standard for Python packages.

## Why GitHub?

1. **Most secure** - No API tokens needed
2. **Automatic** - Publish on release creation
3. **Standard** - 99% of Python packages use this
4. **Simple** - I've already created all the files you need

## What Happens After You Configure GitHub Publisher?

1. You push your code to GitHub
2. You create a "Release" (like v1.0.0)
3. GitHub automatically builds and publishes to PyPI
4. Done! Your package is live
